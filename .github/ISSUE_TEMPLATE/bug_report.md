**Details**

Explain in as much detail as possible what’s wrong. Since this is HTML/JS, it requires quite a lot of explanation.


**How to reproduce**

1. Explain what
2. steps you
3. need to
4. do to
5. have the
6. issue happen



**Expected behavior**

Explain what (you think) should happen
(If it’s intended, I’ll tell you, if you think it’s dumb, then I’ll change it most of the time.)


**Actual behavior**

What happens? Again, explain in detail.


**Locate the issue**

Where do you think the issue happened? Quote the line of code if necessary.


**Notes**

Any extra information goes here, e.g. if you aren’t an expert in HTML/JS, say “Please be gentle, I’m not an expert.”


**Technical details**

OS:  (If you don’t know the *exact* version, just say, for example, macOS High Sierra latest version or macOS latest version. For Windows, put what build you are using, e.g. Windows 10 Professional, and for some older versions of Windows, put your service pack.)

Editor: (Put what HTML or JS editor you are using.)
