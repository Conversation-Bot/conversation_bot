# Conversational Bot
I'm working on a conversational bot that will be able to give you an answer to (almost) anything you say to it or ask it. I might need a bruteforcer, [but not now](https://github.com/Conversation-Bot/conversation_bot/projects/1#card-16162391). I also will need lots of help because *I'm not gonna code this entire thing on my own, you know*. I'm new to JS, but I'm a master python coder, so if anyone knows how to port JS to Py please let me know.

I will also release only polished versions until the final version is all polished. (Except in the [dev branch](https://github.com/Conversation-Bot/conversation_bot/tree/dev/conversation%20bot), where I will possibly release full, **_tested_** code. I will _never_ release untested or broken code.)

# Info
I am making this project as a personal challenge. I have been learning Javascript for over **5** months now, so I decided to make this big project. To discuss this personally, ask a question without anyone else seeing it, or if you want to use this in your website, please contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com. **Do not email me for no reason whatsoever. Seriously.**

Or, you can contact me if you want to... play a game of Smash Bros or something...

# How to Run
I have HTML, JS, and CSS files. I will also have a .txt file if your computer is bad and can't run html files lol. Either way PLEASE USE THE HTML FILE IT IS WAY BETTER. HTML EDITORS DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN THIS CODE FOR SOME REASON LOL.

# Commits
Don't meme with your commits (memeing the title is okay though, who cares really?).

Only commit if you really need to.

Be nice to people who don't like the commit (and be nice in general.)

Must be approved by me unless I gave you complete access to this repos.

Don't backseat mod (e.g. Doing things a person with write access would do, such as saying that you approve a pull request. If you have contributed before and approve though, ping me and I will approve or decline it.)

# Comment Rules
Be nice to others (no-brainer, really)

Don't meme, again.

Don't post anything like +1, I agree, etc.

If someone disagrees, don't be all "My request is better than any you'll ever make!" and other things like that.

Don't be toxic.

Make fun of Windows 8 every time or ban xd
