# Conversational-Bot
I'm working on a conversational bot that will be able to give you an answer to anything you say to it or ask it. I'll need bruteforcing and much more. I'm new to JS, but I'm a master python coder, so if anyone knows how to port JS to Py please let me know. I will also release only polished versions until the final version is all polished.

# Info
I am making this project as a personal challenge. I have been learning Javascript for over 5 months now, so I decided to make this big project. To discuss this, ask a question without anyone else seeing it, or if you want to use this in your website, please contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com.

# Issue form
To submit issues:
1. Explain the problem in detail.
2. Explain how to recreate it (include all optional steps too.)
3. Explain what you think should happen.
4. Explain what actually happens.
5. Tell me what you think I can do to fix it.
6. Locate where you think the problem is.
7. Any extra notes.
8. Technical details (e.g what program or website you are using to run the code, OS, etc.)

# How to Run
I have HTML, JS, and CSS files. I will also have a .txt (.rtf for some) file if your computer is bad and can't run html files lol. Either way PLEASE USE THE HTML FILE IT IS WAY BETTER.
