# Conversational Bot
I'm working on a conversational bot that will be able to give you an answer to (almost) anything you say to it or ask it. I might need a bruteforcer, [but not now](https://github.com/Conversation-Bot/conversation_bot/projects/1#card-16162391). I also will need lots of help because *I'm not gonna code this entire thing on my own, you know*. I'm new to JS, but I'm a master python coder, so if anyone knows how to port JS to Py please let me know.

I will also release only polished versions until the final version is all polished. (Except in the [dev branch](https://github.com/Conversation-Bot/conversation_bot/tree/dev/conversation%20bot), where I will possibly release full, **_tested_** code. I will _never_ release untested or broken code.)

# Info
I am making this project as a personal challenge. I have been learning Javascript for over **5** months now, so I decided to make this big project. To discuss this personally, ask a question without anyone else seeing it, or if you want to use this in your website, please contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com. **Do not email me for no reason whatsoever. Seriously.**

Or, you can contact me if you want to... play a game of Smash Bros or something...
