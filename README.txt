Conversational Bot
I'm working on a conversational bot that will be able to give you an answer to (almost) anything you say to it or ask it. I might need a bruteforcer, but not now. I also will need lots of help because I'm not gonna code this entire thing on my own, you know. I'm new to JS, but I'm a master python coder, so if anyone knows how to port JS to Py please let me know.

I will also release only polished versions until the final version is all polished. (Except in the dev branch, where I will possibly release full, tested code. I will never release untested or broken code.)
Info
I am making this project as a personal challenge. I have been learning Javascript for over 5 months now, so I decided to make this big project. To discuss this personally, ask a question without anyone else seeing it, or if you want to use this in your website, please contact me at irishempire77@gmail.com. Do not email me for no reason whatsoever. Seriously.
Or, you can contact me if you want to... play a game of Smash Bros or something...
Issue form
To submit issues:
1. Explain the problem in detail.
2. Explain how to recreate it (include all optional steps too.)
3. Explain what you think should happen.
4. Explain what actually happens.
5. Tell me what you think I can do to fix it.
6. Locate where you think the problem is.
7. Any extra notes.
8. Technical details (e.g. what program or website you are using to run the code, OS, BIOS, etc.)
Make sure to check the issues tab to check if it's been reported already.
How to Run
I have HTML, JS, and CSS files. I will also have a .txt file if your computer is bad and can't run html files lol. Either way PLEASE USE THE HTML FILE IT IS WAY BETTER. HTML EDITORS DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN THIS CODE FOR SOME REASON LOL.
Commits
Don't meme with your commits (memeing the title is okay though, who cares really?).
Only commit if you really need to.
Be nice to people who don't like the commit (and be nice in general.)
Must be approved by me unless I gave you complete access to this repos.
Don't backseat mod (e.g. Doing things a person with write access would do, such as saying that you approve a pull request. If you have contributed before and approve though, ping me and I will approve or decline it.)
Comment Rules
Be nice to others (no-brainer, really)
Don't meme, again.
Don't post anything like +1, I agree, etc.
If someone disagrees, don't be all "My request is better than any you'll ever make!"
Don't be toxic.
Make fun of windows 8 every time or ban xd
Bot
There will be a bot for this that will do things usually automatically, run by a python script "cb.py." It may have some errors (haven't used python in a while) but it is an easy way for me to update the bot while in class. I can schedule any changes I want, anytime I want. Usually, before school, I schedule a few scripts I had written the night before. I may not be able to every day, but incase I know I will be unable to schedule scripts, I will schedule them days in advance. Note that this bot will not be publicly released.
Side Project
Side Project "Project HTML-01" is a small side project I am doing to showcase some things with HTML. It won't be much, but I still will probably focus on it more than this since I am basically finished with this. You can view it on GitLab or GitHub.
